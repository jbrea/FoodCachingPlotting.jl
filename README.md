# FoodCachingPlotting

The code in this repository defines some plotting methods to visualize the results of
fitting and simulating food caching experiments. This repository is a submodule of [FoodCaching](../FoodCaching).

Run the [scripts](scripts) `fig1.jl`, `figappendix.jl` and `prediction.jl` to reproduce the figures in the paper.

Run the [scripts](scripts) `loss_dashboard.jl` to monitor log files produced during
fitting with [FoodCachingFitting](../FoodCachingFitting) and `sim_dashboard.jl` to
visualize simulated experiments.
